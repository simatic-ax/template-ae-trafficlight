This this just a dummy repo for the application example "ae-trafficlight". It works as a placeholder so that the package with the application can be hosted.
If you want to create a new apax project based on that package-template just :

```bash
apax create @simatic-ax/ae-trafficlight --registry https://npm.pkg.github.com <your-new-projectname>
```
